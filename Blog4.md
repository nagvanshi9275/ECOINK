# How to Maximise Space with Custom Laundry Cabinet Designs

In many Australian homes, laundry rooms are compact and multi-purpose, making smart storage solutions essential for keeping them both practical and visually appealing. The challenge lies in maximising every centimetre without overcrowding the space. A custom laundry cabinet provides a tailored way to improve organisation, add style, and ensure every feature works for your household’s needs.

A well-designed laundry can make daily chores easier, create more storage in unexpected places, and enhance the value of your home. With the right approach, even the smallest laundry can become efficient and attractive.

Below are nine proven ideas for custom cabinets in compact laundries, based on what works best in Australian homes.

## 1. Go Vertical with Floor-to-Ceiling Cabinets

When floor space is limited, the only way to go is up. Installing floor-to-ceiling cabinets helps you take advantage of unused vertical space for storing everything from detergents and cleaning supplies to spare linens and seasonal items.

Opt for tall cabinets with adjustable shelves so you can customise the storage to suit your needs. Including a mix of open shelving and closed cupboards can also give you quick access to frequently used items while keeping clutter out of sight.

## 2. Use Overhead Cabinets Above Appliances

If your washing machine and dryer sit side by side or are stacked, the space above them is often wasted. Overhead cabinets are a simple yet effective way to use this area for storing laundry essentials, baskets, and extra towels.

Consider using lift-up or sliding doors for overhead cabinets; these are easier to open in tight spaces and won’t block walkways.

## 3. Incorporate Pull-Out Hampers and Baskets

Loose laundry baskets can quickly eat up precious floor space. Instead, pull-out hampers built into lower cabinets keep dirty clothes hidden and organised. You can even have multiple compartments for sorting whites, darks, and delicates right from the start.

Similarly, pull-out wire baskets or drawers can be used to store cleaning products, pet supplies, or reusable bags.

## 4. Combine Laundry and Utility Storage

If your laundry room also serves as a general utility space, your custom cabinets can be designed to store more than just laundry essentials. You could include:

- A broom and mop cupboard with vertical storage.  
- Pull-out shelves for small appliances like steamers or vacuum cleaners.  
- Hooks inside cabinet doors for dustpans or cleaning gloves.  

This multi-functional approach means one room can handle multiple household tasks efficiently.

## 5. Install Folding or Pull-Down Benchtops

Folding laundry is much easier with a benchtop, but in small laundries, permanent counter space isn’t always possible. A clever solution is a fold-down benchtop fixed to the wall or built into cabinetry, which can be pulled out when needed and folded away afterwards.

Some designs even incorporate pull-out ironing boards, allowing you to switch between laundry and ironing without taking up extra space.

## 6. Opt for Light Colours and Gloss Finishes

While storage is important, aesthetics matter too—especially in compact rooms. Choosing light-coloured cabinetry (like white, pale grey, or soft beige) can make the room feel larger and more open. Gloss finishes reflect light, adding brightness and giving the illusion of extra space.

Pair your cabinetry with sleek, minimal handles or push-to-open doors for a clean, modern look.

## 7. Use Open Shelving for Everyday Items

Not everything needs to be hidden behind closed doors. Adding open shelves above your sink or between cabinets creates space for everyday items like washing powder, glass jars, or fabric softener in decorative containers.

This also lets you add personal touches like plants, baskets, or small artwork, so your laundry feels warm and inviting.

## 8. Integrate a Drying Rack or Hanging Rail

Air drying is kinder to clothes, but freestanding drying racks can be bulky. Custom cabinets can include:

- Pull-out drying racks that slide neatly away when not in use.  
- Overhead hanging rails for shirts and delicate garments.  

This makes the drying process part of your laundry workflow without taking up valuable floor space.

## 9. Choose Moisture-Resistant Materials

Because laundry deals with water and humidity, your cabinetry needs to be built from moisture-resistant materials to prevent warping, swelling, or mould growth.

Consider:

- Laminated plywood or moisture-resistant MDF for the structure.  
- High-quality laminates or polyurethane finishes for surfaces.  
- Stainless steel handles and hardware for durability.  

## Practical Design Considerations for Compact Laundry Cabinets

When planning cabinetry for a small laundry, every decision should be made with function in mind. Consider these tips for a successful design:

- Plan for ventilation to protect both appliances and cabinetry from moisture build-up.  
- Measure appliances accurately to ensure a perfect fit.  
- Choose adjustable shelving so storage can adapt to changing needs.  
- Incorporate multi-functional elements such as folding stations or hidden ironing boards.  

These practical touches can make daily laundry tasks easier while keeping the space neat.

## Practical Tips for Choosing the Right Custom Cabinets

When designing cabinets for a small laundry room, it’s important to think beyond aesthetics. Here are some factors to guide your decisions:

- Measure with precision – Even a few millimetres off can affect how well cabinets fit in tight spaces.  
- Prioritise vertical space – Tall cabinets can make the most of limited square metres without cluttering the floor.  
- Consider your workflow – Arrange cabinets so that washing, drying, folding and storing flow seamlessly.  
- Choose durable finishes – Moisture-resistant materials ensure your cabinetry stays in great condition despite the humid laundry environment.  
- Think about accessibility – Pull-out hampers, slide-out shelves and adjustable heights can make everyday tasks more comfortable.  

## Bringing Your Compact Laundry Room to Life

Designing a functional yet stylish laundry space in a small area is all about using every inch wisely. Vertical cabinets, pull-out hampers, and over-the-appliance shelving help create order without clutter. Choosing durable materials that resist moisture and daily wear ensures your investment lasts for years. Thoughtful touches like built-in drying racks or concealed ironing boards add convenience and make the room more pleasant to use.
