# Luxury Bathroom Vanities: What to Consider

When upgrading your bathroom, the vanity is often the centrepiece that sets the tone for the entire space. A luxury bathroom vanity is more than just a functional piece of furniture. It is a design statement that can enhance both the style and value of your home. If you are planning a bathroom renovation in Australia, knowing what to consider before selecting your vanity will ensure you make a choice that is beautiful, durable and perfectly suited to your needs.

This guide covers key factors such as size, style, materials, storage, and installation to help you make an informed decision.

## 1. Define Your Style

Before you start browsing, think about the overall design theme of your bathroom. Luxury bathroom vanities come in a wide variety of styles, from sleek modern designs to ornate traditional pieces.

**Modern and minimalist**  
Clean lines, [handleless](/blogs/handles-or-no-handles-what-s-the-best-option-for-your-new-cabinets) drawers, and high-gloss finishes. Ideal for contemporary Australian homes with a focus on simplicity.

**Classic and timeless**  
Rich timber tones, decorative moulding, and stone benchtops that create a warm, sophisticated feel.

**Coastal and Hamptons**  
White or pastel tones, shaker-style cabinetry, and brushed nickel hardware for a relaxed yet elegant look.

**Pro tip:** Your vanity should complement the rest of your bathroom fixtures, tiles, and colour palette. A cohesive design will make the space feel more luxurious.

## 2. Choose the Right Size and Configuration

The size of your vanity will depend on the dimensions of your bathroom and how you plan to use the space.

**Single vanity:** Perfect for smaller bathrooms or powder rooms. Offers sufficient storage without overwhelming the room.

**Double vanity:** A great option for master bathrooms, allowing two people to use the space at once. This configuration can make the morning routine far more efficient.

**Custom-built vanity:** If your bathroom has an unusual layout, a custom design will maximise functionality while fitting perfectly within the available space.

**Pro tip:** When measuring, factor in clearance for doors, drawers, and foot traffic. A luxury vanity should feel proportionate, not cramped or overpowering.

## 3. Select Premium Materials

One of the defining features of a luxury bathroom vanity is the quality of the materials. High-end finishes not only look stunning but also withstand the humid environment of a bathroom. Investing in quality materials ensures your vanity maintains its beauty for years to come.

**Timber and veneer:** Solid hardwood offers durability and natural beauty. High-quality veneers can provide the same look with more stability.  
**Stone benchtops:** Marble, granite, and engineered stone are popular for their elegance and resilience. Stone resists heat and moisture, making it ideal for bathroom use.  
**High-grade hardware:** Soft-close hinges, solid metal handles, and smooth-gliding drawers enhance both function and longevity.

## 4. Prioritise Storage Solutions

A luxury vanity should be as practical as it is beautiful. Storage is essential for keeping the bathroom tidy and organised. Smart storage solutions will reduce clutter and make daily routines easier.

Consider options such as:

- Deep drawers for towels and bulky items.  
- Shallow drawers with dividers for cosmetics and grooming tools.  
- Hidden compartments for electrical outlets or appliances.  
- Open shelving for displaying decorative items or baskets.  

## 5. Decide on Mounting Style

The way your vanity is mounted can significantly influence the overall look of your bathroom. Your choice will depend on your bathroom’s style, storage needs, and plumbing layout.

**Freestanding:** Offers a traditional furniture-like appearance. Easy to install and can work with almost any bathroom style.

**Wall-mounted (floating):** Creates a modern, airy feel by exposing more floor space. This style also makes cleaning the bathroom floor simpler.

**Semi-recessed:** Combines elements of both, with the vanity partially mounted into the wall for a custom look.

## 6. Think About the Basin and Tapware

The basin and tapware you choose should complement your vanity in both style and proportion.

**Undermount basins:** Provide a seamless look and make cleaning easier.  
**Vessel basins:** Sit above the countertop, making a bold design statement.  
**Integrated basins:** Crafted from the same material as the countertop for a unified appearance.

**Pro tip:** For tapware, consider finishes like brushed gold, matte black, or polished chrome to coordinate with your vanity’s hardware and the overall bathroom design.

## 7. Factor in Lighting and Mirrors

A luxury vanity setup is incomplete without the right lighting and mirror design.

**Task lighting:** Positioned on either side of the mirror to eliminate shadows on the face.  
**Backlit mirrors:** Add a modern touch and create soft, ambient light.  
**Large mirrors:** Enhance the sense of space and reflect light for a brighter bathroom.

**Pro tip:** The combination of mirror style and lighting placement can elevate the vanity’s visual impact.

## 8. Consider Maintenance and Longevity

Luxury vanities are an investment, so it is important to choose materials and finishes that are easy to maintain. Opt for moisture-resistant coatings and non-porous benchtops to prevent stains and water damage. Soft-close drawers and high-quality hinges will also extend the life of the vanity.

**Pro tip:** Regular cleaning with gentle, non-abrasive products will help maintain the surface’s shine and prevent wear.
