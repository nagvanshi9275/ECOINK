# Magri Cabinets - SEO & Admin CMS Guide 🚀

This guide explains the new SEO and Content Management features added to your website. We've designed these tools to be powerful yet simple to use, helping your website rank higher on Google without needing technical coding skills.

## 1. The SEO Dashboard (Your Secret Weapon)
On every Project, Blog, and Service page, you will now see an **SEO Meta Box** at the bottom. This is where you control how Google sees your page.

### Key Tools:
*   **Focus Keyphrase:** Tell the system which "Search Word" you want to rank for (e.g., *"Custom Kitchens Melbourne"*).
*   **SEO Title:** This is the blue link people click on Google.
*   **Meta Description:** The small paragraph under the link on Google that "sells" your page to the user.
*   **Social Preview:** See exactly how your page will look when shared on **Facebook or Twitter**.

## 2. Real-Time SEO Scoring (0-100)
As you type, our "Smart Engine" calculates an SEO score for you. It’s like a personal SEO consultant sitting next to you!

*   **Green (Good):** You're doing great! Google will love this.
*   **Orange (Warning):** Small fixes needed (e.g., "Your title is a bit too short").
*   **Red (Error):** Critical issue (e.g., "You forgot to add a Meta Description").

**What makes a 100/100 score?**
1.  Using your **Keyphrase** in the title and the first paragraph.
2.  Keeping titles between **50-60 characters** (so they don't get cut off).
3.  Writing a description that is helpful and inviting.

## 3. Readability & Content Analysis
Google prioritizes pages that are easy for humans to read. Our system checks:
*   **Reading Ease:** Are your sentences too long or complicated?
*   **Word Count:** Is there enough information for Google to "understand" the page?
*   **Syllacle Count:** It automatically suggests if your vocabulary is too complex for a general audience.

## 4. Image SEO (Faster & Smarter)
Images are a huge part of your business. We've made them "Google-friendly" automatically:

*   **Alt Text:** You can now add descriptions to every image (e.g., *"Modern Black Kitchen Wardrobe"*). Google uses this text to "see" your images.
*   **Automatic Optimization:** We've added a system that **instantly shrinks large images** when you upload them.
    *   *Result:* Your pages load faster, users stay longer, and your upload time is reduced from minutes to seconds.
*   **Card vs. Hero Images:** You can now choose a specific "Thumbnail" image for the project list and a different "Hero" image for the detail page.

---

## 5. Global SEO Settings
Under the **"SEO Settings"** tab in your sidebar, you can set site-wide details:
*   **Business Info:** Set your address, phone number, and hours. This helps Google show you in "Local Search" (the Map pack).
*   **Sitemap:** The system automatically generates a "Map" of your site for Google to explore effortlessly.
*   **Social Links:** Connect your Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn in one place.

"With these new tools, you no longer have to guess if your website is ready for Google. The system guides you step-by-step: **Type, check the score, fix the red dots, and Save.** Your website is now a powerful marketing tool that works for you 24/7."
