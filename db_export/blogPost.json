    "content": "\n            <h2>The Future of Kitchen Design</h2>\n            <p class=\"lead\">As we move into 2025, kitchen design in Melbourne is shifting towards a blend of organic textures, sustainable materials, and \"hidden\" technology.</p>\n            <p>At Magri Cabinets, we've seen a surge in requests for handless designs and integrated appliances. The goal is to create a seamless, furniture-like look for the kitchen that integrates perfectly with open-plan living spaces.</p>\n            <h3>1. Natural Wood Accents</h3>\n            <p>Warm timber tones are making a big comeback. Whether it's a full Tasmanian Oak island bench or subtle walnut shelving, natural wood adds warmth to the often cold surfaces of a kitchen.</p>\n            <h3>2. Bold Backsplashes</h3>\n            <p>Moving away from plain white tiles, homeowners are opting for stone slabs that match their benchtops or vibrant, textured tiles that serve as a focal point.</p>\n            <h3>3. Smart Storage Solutions</h3>\n            <p>Functionality is key. We're installing more pull-out pantries, corner optimizations, and dedicated charging stations inside drawers to keep counters clutter-free.</p>\n            <p>Ready to upgrade? Contact Magri Cabinets today for a custom design consultation.</p>\n        ",

In Melbourne's diverse homes, we see everything from ultra-modern floating vanities to classic shaker styles.</p>\n            <h3>Consider Your Storage Needs</h3>\n            <p>How many people use the bathroom? If it's a family bathroom, deep drawers are essential for towels and toiletries. For a powder room, a minimalist floating unit might be better.</p>\n            <h3>Material Matters</h3>\n            <p>Since the bathroom is a wet environment, high moisture resistance (HMR) is crucial. We use only the best HMR boards and premium finishes to ensure your vanity lasts for years.</p>\n            <h3>Plumbing Layout</h3>\n            <p>Before you fall in love with a design, check your plumbing. Wall-mounted vanities require plumbing to be moved into the wall, which can add to your renovation cost but offers a much cleaner look.</p>\n        ",
