When [renovating a kitchen](/kitchen-cabinets) or customising cabinetry, one of the biggest decisions homeowners face is choosing the right finish. In Australia, the two most popular options are **2Pac (also called 2-pack or 2K paint)** and **vinyl wrap (thermolaminated)**.

When it comes to **2 Pac vs. vinyl wrap**, both can deliver stylish, durable results, but they serve different purposes—and understanding the differences could save you money, time, and future frustration.

## What Is 2 Pac Finish?

2 Pac is a premium finish made from a combination of a polyurethane or acrylic base and a hardener. Applied by spray and left to cure, it creates a tough, smooth surface similar to an automotive finish. Its versatility makes it a favourite among designers and renovators alike.

## What Is Vinyl Wrap Finish?

Vinyl wrap (thermolaminated) methods involve bonding a sheet of vinyl film under heat and vacuum onto shaped MDF panels. This film is thermally bonded to the panel under heat and vacuum pressure, resulting in a seamless finish, especially around profiles and edges.

### What Makes It Appealing

**Budget-friendly**  
Vinyl wrap is a more cost-effective finish, making it ideal for renovations where keeping costs down is a priority.

**Seamless finish**  
Because the vinyl is wrapped around the panel, there are no visible joins. This creates a smooth, factory-finished appearance.

**Quick production**  
Vinyl wrap cabinets are faster to produce and install, which is ideal for time-sensitive projects.

Vinyl wrap is best suited for homeowners looking for an affordable, stylish finish with minimal fuss. While it may not have the same longevity as 2 Pac, vinyl wrap offers a clean, modern look that can easily elevate a space without breaking the budget.

Vinyl wrap performs well under normal conditions but tends to degrade faster when exposed to heat or heavy use. Edge peeling, bubbling, or shrinking can appear around hot appliances like ovens or dishwashers after 5 to 7 years.

---

### Cleaning and Maintenance

2 Pac’s smooth surface makes it easy to wipe clean, especially in gloss or satin finishes. It resists grime and stains and holds up well under regular cleaning.

Vinyl wrap can be a little trickier. High-gloss vinyl, in particular, may show fingerprints or collect dust more easily. Some textured versions can trap dirt or feel slightly uneven.

---

### Repairs

2 Pac is more forgiving when it comes to damage. Scratches and chips can often be repaired without replacing the entire door.

Vinyl wrap, on the other hand, is difficult to repair once it starts peeling or bubbling. In most cases, the entire panel will need to be replaced.
